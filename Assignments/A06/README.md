### intro

I will be going over the "Git" tool on replit. Git is used in various ways in replit in a way that makes it easier for the user to modify github repositories. In replit you can choose to login to pair a github account with your replit account. This gives replit access to your github repositories.

### creating a github Repository

[created repo](https://github.com/jorcsan/present)

For example you can simply create an empty replit. Then using the git pane under the "tools" section. A menu will appear showing your username under "repo author". If your Github account is not yet connected it will ask you to login. It will than give You an option to name the repository that you wish to create. Lastly click the button labeled "create repository on Github" and the repository will be created. THe repository will be empty and first until you make changes than commit and push them.

### cloning a Repository

A repository can be cloned using commands in the shell terminal. 

cloning a existing repo [git clone <url-to-your-repository>]
first change into sub directory   [cd git-demo]

This would impport all the folders and files in that repository into a replit. They can than be edited within replit the changes can be "pushed" to github. 


### import a repository

YOu can create a replit and import a repository and skip the shell commands. After importing you can modify the repo however you like. Than you can commit and push any chages that you make to update the repo on github. You can add folders and files to repos or edit existing files. This assignment folder "A06" was created on Replit and than pushed to github.

### create branches

You can use the Git pane to easily create branches without any shell commands. All that has to be done is to click the button that says create branch and than publish the branch.

In a branch you can edit code and than later on merge the code with the main branch. This way multiple people can work on the same code on their own. They can work on different parts of the code without affecting the main branch immediately. If two people try to push changes to main that conflict with eachother. If they edited the same line of code for example, this will cause a "merge conflict".

### replit badge

[make a badge](https://docs.replit.com/programming-ide/using-git-on-replit/running-github-repositories-replit#adding-a-run-on-replit-badge)

you can place a badge in your repos readme that will run the Repo on replit automatically.
